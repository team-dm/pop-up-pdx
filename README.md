Pop-Up PDX is an app that gives new food businesses the platform to advertise their pop up event to the public. 
It is a social media site that supports short-term, temporary food events that are "here today, gone tomorrow". 
It connects small food businesses with current spaces that they can utilize to test their market and create a long term, lasting impression with potential customers. 
This platform also allows the businesses to communicate their brandâ€™s promise to potential customers through the use of a unique and engaging physical environment while creating an 
immersive dining experience.
